Motion and Energy Equations (work)
#######################################################################

I can't stop to say "this work was the first task that I did and was very happy with it until now". 

# Consideration

Within this work, the task can be seen that is to formulate the ODEs sytem of equations by using a function. 
The function will be called in order to plot various plots such as velocities, energies,........

Just go through the jupyter file which is containing the markdown for relevant details.
